# ML Model with Pickle (Deployment Ready)

## Description:
This project contains a basic Machine Learning model built using Python, scikit-learn, and saved using Pickle.

## Files:
- `model.pkl`: Pre-trained model ready to be used in applications.
- `app.py`: (Coming soon) Flask API to serve the model.
- `templates/index.html`: (Coming soon) Web form for user inputs.

## What's Next?
Iâ€™m currently learning Flask to deploy this model as a web app.

## Skills Practiced:
- Python
- Machine Learning (Iris/Titanic/Home Price dataset)
- Model Serialization with Pickle
- Flask (Learning phase)
